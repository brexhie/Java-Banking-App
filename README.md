# Java-Banking-App
A basic banking app made with Java.

Upon running the program, the user is met with multiple questions displaying after another prompting them to fill in their information.
After filling in their information, the user is met with a menu prompting them to either make a deposit, withdrawal, display their information or exit the program.
If the user chooses to make a deposit, they can enter the deposit amount and the accurate interest rate will be added.
Their balance will be updated and saved.
If the user entered an invalid value, an error message pops up and takes them back to make a selection.
If the user chooses to make a withdrawal, their balance is displayed, and they are prompted to enter the withdrawal amount.
After the user entered the amount, a message is displayed to inform them of the amount that was withdrawn and their current balance.
Their balance is then updated and saved.
If the user attempts to withdraw more than their current balance, a message displays to inform them of their invalid input and takes them back to make a selection.
If the user wishes to see their information, they will be able to see it by choosing “Display Information”.
If the user chooses to exit, the program will display a message and then end.
